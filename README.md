`# REACT MUSIC PROJECT 

Put into practice all the previous knowledge learned in the master to develop a music app project using React.

## General analysis

 With YouMusic, we have created an innovative project in React that allows users to listen to music in a way similar to SoundCloud or Spotify. With our player, users can listen to songs, albums, create playlists, and save their favorite songs to listen to them anytime and anywhere.

In addition, in YouMusic, users have access to a personalized profile where they can edit all their data and settings at any time. The application is designed with a minimalist style and an intuitive interface that makes it very easy to use for any user.

Our goal is to provide a high-quality, hassle-free music listening experience for all music lovers. With YouMusic, you can listen to your favorite music anytime and anywhere, and access your songs and playlists at any time. Download YouMusic today and enjoy the best music on your device!

#### 2. Future implementations

- React-Query
- Styled components
- Delete songs in playlist 

#### 3. Advantages of using React

- React requires less code compared to other development platforms.
- Reusable components: This makes the application more scalable and easier to maintain as errors will occur in the component's own functionality or in its   communication with the rest.
- Improves the user experience when navigating the web application, the speed at which pages load and facilitates the maintenance of the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
